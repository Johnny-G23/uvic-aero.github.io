# Aircraft Design Requirements 2019-2020 

*Work-In-Progess as of July 25th 2019*

Interest in airplane design is what started Aero, and UAS Canada judges want to support fixed wing design. Leading us to the conclusion the development of a fixed wing aircraft will increase our chances of winning competition. An over-reaching design requirement is that the aircraft will help Aero win the UAS-student competition.

## Summary of Requirements

|Requirement|Description|Value|Units|
|:------:|------|:------:|----|
|1|Endurance|45|minutes|
|2|Cruise Speed|10-20|m/s|
|3|Maximum Weight|10|kg|

## Breakdown of Requirements

This section will cover in detail why each requirement was made

### Reqireument 1: Endurance 

Flight windows at competition are generally 45 minutes or less, and flying for the entire time window should be possible if we want to hinder our chances of completing the mission.

### Requirement 2: Cruise Speed

Any speed below 10 m/s calls into question why we would use a fixed wing, which are generally harder to design, build, and fly while costing more than a multirotor which can achieve speeds of **8 m/s**. 

Speeds above 20 m/s puts too high a burden on finding cost effective camera solutions to meet the shutter speed requiremnts imposed by speeds going this high. For further information on why these are coupled see *Camera Requirements Doc* 

### Requirement 3: Maximum Weight

Perhaps the easiest requirement jusification. The competition doesn't allow aircraft over 10 kg. 

*Note: this does not imply that a 10kg aircraft is ideal, simiply the maximum it could be*
